# Image Processing Algorithms with CUDA, OpenCV, and OpenMP

## Overview
The Implementation of several image processing algorithms project combines the power of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), and OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) to accelerate image processing tasks on GPUs and multicore CPUs. This project aims to leverage the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs and CPUs to enhance the performance and efficiency of image processing algorithms, enabling real-time processing of large-scale image datasets.

By utilizing CUDA, OpenCV, and OpenMP, this project enables the implementation of various image processing algorithms, such as image filtering, edge detection, object recognition, and more. The parallel processing capabilities of CUDA and OpenMP, combined with the rich set of image processing functions provided by OpenCV, allow for rapid and efficient execution of complex image processing tasks on compatible hardware.
